# DT-Internship Assignments

This repository contains my submissions for the DeepThought internship assignments, organized by task.

## Task 1: Events API (Backend Development)
This task involved building a clean, minimal Express.js API for managing event documents in MongoDB using the native `mongodb` driver. It implements a set of CRUD endpoints and supports file uploads via `multer`.

View details and setup instructions in the `task-1/README.md` file.

## Task 2: API Documentation
This task involved creating API documentation for a new "Nudge" functionality. The documentation defines the object data model and outlines the CRUD operations required for the API.
